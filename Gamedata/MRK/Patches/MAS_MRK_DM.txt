MRK DM and DM(r) Command Pod README

This IVA updates the MRK Descent Module found as part of the Commonwealth Rockets
mod (https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/164365-13-commonwealth-rockets-tea-powered-spaceflight-in-development/).

You will need to install Module Manager and the ASET Props pack, as well as
Near Future Props (https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/166941-131-near-future-props-prop-assets-for-iva-developers-december-15th-2017/).
Obviously, you need the MRK command pod.

MechJeb is very strongly recommended.  Chatterer and RealChute are
recommended.

A short orientation to the cockpit layout:

Most of the pilot functionality is focused on the left (first IVA) seat.

Several sections of the cockpit have separate power switches located near
them (the X-pointer, the FDAI, the IMP/Globus, the clocks, and the MechJeb
data entry panels).

Some of the features to look at in this build:

The instrument backlight is a dimmer switch, not an on-off switch (it's on
the left seat's left panel).

Action Group buttons between the windows do not illuminate if there are no actions
assigned to that group.

The MechJeb control panel (lower center) has a numeric
keypad that allows the crew to type in numbers, and mode buttons
that allow the panel to read from or write to various MJ autopilot
"registers" (launch altitude, launch inclination, Ap, Pe, and Altitude).

Some multi-mode buttons have dimmed backlights on some captions -
for instance, the speed mode button (switch between surface, orbit,
and target) and the FDAI scale buttons illuminate when enabled,
but inactive options are dimmer than the active one.

In addition to the advanced MFDs available to the pilot, there is a
basic data monitor.  This monitor can be set to display one of several
types of information by simply tapping on it to change pages.
