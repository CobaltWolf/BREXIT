	description = SKMC looked at BDB's Bossart launch vehicle and decided that it was too complicated. Shortly thereafter, they introduced a conveniently similar rocket. This fuel tank is the first to be manufactured using nothing but sheet steel and a hammer. The reinforced corrugated segment can have other parts surface attached to it, but the smooth upper section cannot owing to its thin, pressure stabilized (known as 'balloon tank') construction. In return, this fuel tank has a lower dry mass than traditional tanks of equivalent size.
